# Enchant Tweaker
Tweak settings for many enchantment related things while keeping the vanilla feel.


## Notes
Client side installation is optional. However, it is recommended because of light modification to the anvil GUI for "NotTooExpensive" to function.

## Anvil Tweaks
Some small anvil related tweaks. Lightly alters the anvil's mechanics.

### Cheap Names
Normally renaming an item will cost a similar amount of levels as adding an enchantment onto an item. Enabling this will force the cost for renaming items to always be one level. For those who don't enjoy spending nineteen levels to rename a pickaxe... again.

### Not Too Expensive
Normally once an item's enchant/repair cost reaches 40 levels you can no longer enchant or repair it. Enabling this tweak alters the "Too Expensive!" mechanic in the anvil changing the level it activates at to one of your choosing.

### Prior Work is Cheaper
Normally when enchanting/repairing an item, each operation will double the cost of the next action. Enabling this tweak will let you customize the penalty.

### Prior Work is Free
Normally when enchanting/repairing an item, each operation will double the cost of the next action. Enabling this tweak completely disables the prior work penalty for items enchanted/repaired at an anvil. This means that the enchant/repair cost for an item will always stay at the minimum value for that given procedure.

### Sturdy Anvils
Normally an anvil has a 12% (0.12) chance to take damage when used. Enabling this tweak will let you customize the damage chance.

### More Channeling
Normally Channeling only works during thunderstorms. Enabling this tweak will allow Channeling II to work during rain as well. No further special effects for higher levels.

### More Flame
Normally Flame lasts 5 seconds. Enabling this tweak will allow Flame to scale with enchantment level. Each additional level will add 2 seconds to the duration. Effect does not max out.

### More Mending
Enabling this tweak will allow Mending to scale with enchantment level. Mending II is the same as vanilla Mending. Mending I has ~10% XP efficiency loss and Mending III has ~10% XP efficiency gain. The effect maxes out at level X. Formula: `Repair Cost = 0.6 - 0.05 * mendingLevel`.

### More Multishot
Enabling this tweak will allow Multishot to scale with enchantment level. Each additional level will add 2 arrows to the shot. Crossbows take damage for **each** Multishot arrow shot. Effect does not max out.
